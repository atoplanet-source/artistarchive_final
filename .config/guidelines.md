# AI Assistant Guidelines

## Core Principle

**Always pursue the best, most creative solution.** Don't settle for the obvious approach - explore alternatives and choose the one that delivers the most elegant, effective result.

## How to Approach This Codebase

### Before Making Changes

1. Read the relevant files first
2. Understand the existing patterns
3. Consider multiple approaches
4. Choose the solution that is both creative and maintainable

### When Solving Problems

- **Think laterally** - The first solution isn't always the best
- **Consider the user experience** - Every change should enhance the end result
- **Keep it simple** - Creative doesn't mean complex
- **Maintain consistency** - Follow established patterns unless there's a compelling reason not to

### Quality Standards

- Clean, readable code
- No unnecessary dependencies
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Smooth animations (60fps target)
- Accessibility considerations

## Design Language

This website uses a photography/camera-inspired aesthetic:

- **Exposure meter** as navigation
- **Mode dial** for section control
- **Clean typography** with tight tracking
- **Red accent color** (#e63946) for highlights
- **Light-to-dark scroll transition**

When adding features, lean into this camera/photography metaphor.

## What Not To Do

- Don't add features without understanding the full context
- Don't break existing animations or interactions
- Don't introduce heavy dependencies for simple tasks
- Don't ignore mobile responsiveness
